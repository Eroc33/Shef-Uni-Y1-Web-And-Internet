This code is from a 1st year module called "Web and Internet technology" which focused on html, css, and javascript, but also touched on the network protocols that are typically used to deliver such content (i.e http/https).

Lab3 was a task to implement a website with a specific set of features (header, navigation, and image, footer, and semantic main and aside sections), while maintaining readability on all devices using media queries to implement responsiveness.

Lab 5 was a set of small javascript exercises.

Assignment 1 was to create a set of mockups, and talk about accesibility considerations, for designing a personal website.

Assignment 2 was to implement the website designed in assignment 1.

Assignment 2 also asked us to develop something in javascript which used 2d canvas. For this I implemented a sokoban clone, partly as I already had the level data from a different assignment. Note that sokoban will not be playable on newer browsers if accessed using the file:// url scheme as some browsers interpret a page with file:// url acessing a resource with a file:// url as a violation of CORS.
