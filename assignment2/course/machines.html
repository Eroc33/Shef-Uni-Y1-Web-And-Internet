            <blockquote>
                This module provides an introduction to Artificial Intelligence, and to key concepts and problems in the
                field, such as whether a computer is capable of understanding, and whether humans should themselves be
                viewed as machines. It also provides a brief historical overview of the subject and reviews the
                state-of-the-art and open questions in some of the major subareas of AI, pointing out connections to
                research work in the Department. As well as providing a first encounter with the main issues that
                underlie attempts to create Artificial Intelligence, the module also has a more practical component that
                introduces algorithms and data structures for AI problem solving through practical programming examples,
                as well as hands-on experience with simple programming of humanoid robots. The emphasis here is on
                identifying the abstract nature of the problem which is to be solved, matching this to an appropriate
                algorithm or technique and implementing a solution. It also serves as an introduction to programming for
                research rather than for software engineering

                As part of machines and intelligence we use the NAO robots to implement agents based on concepts taught on the course.
